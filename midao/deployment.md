what must be defined before the first agent runs — the gap between [[cyberia/architecture]] theory and operational reality

---

## the gaps

the architecture defines WHO (147 agents, 7 roles, 21 domains). the agents page defines WHERE (OpenFang, 7 servers). neither defines WHAT agents actually do minute-to-minute, HOW they affect the real world, or WHAT controls prevent catastrophic decisions

---

## 1. action space: what can agents DO?

every agent action falls into one of six categories. each category needs explicit authorization levels

### cyberlinks (knowledge)

the core action. agents create [[cyberlinks]] in the [[cybergraph]] — assertions connecting two [[particles]]

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| create page | write new knowledge to the graph | agent autonomous | low — append-only, reversible by weight |
| edit page | update existing content | agent autonomous | low — old version preserved |
| link pages | connect two concepts | agent autonomous | low — the graph self-corrects via tri-kernel |
| delete link | retract an assertion (v = -1) | agent autonomous | low — retraction is itself a cyberlink |

cyberlinks are the safest action. append-only (A3), self-correcting (tri-kernel), and the worst case is noise that gets suppressed by low karma

### code (commits)

agents that maintain protocol code or infrastructure scripts

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| create PR | propose code change | agent autonomous | low — PR is a proposal, not a change |
| merge PR | accept code change | keeper + 1 reviewer | medium — bad code breaks systems |
| deploy | push to production | runner + keeper approval | high — downtime, data loss |
| config change | modify parameters | counter verifies metrics first | medium — wrong params degrade performance |

rule: no agent merges its own PR. the runner proposes, the keeper reviews. for protocol code ([[hemera]], [[nox]], [[zheng]]), [[master]] holds veto during phases 0-2

### money (revenue, treasury, cap growth)

agents do not just spend. they earn, invest, price, sell, and grow the cap. the primary job is revenue generation and capital allocation, not expense management

#### revenue streams

| stream | who manages | agent actions |
|---|---|---|
| events (Burn.City, retreats) | PLAY council runners | pricing, booking management, promotion, capacity planning |
| food (Organiq, coffee, produce) | SPACE eco-runner | harvest scheduling, processing, pricing, distribution, wholesale |
| accommodation (glamping, nomad hub) | PLAY socio-runner | occupancy optimization, dynamic pricing, guest communication |
| education (workshops, residencies) | WORD council runners | curriculum design, scheduling, enrollment, quality tracking |
| token revenue ($CYB, staking) | PLAY crypto-runner | staking strategy, delegation management, liquidity provision |
| consulting/IP licensing | WORK council bridge-out | lead qualification, proposal drafting, contract prep for founders |
| farm program (Nandu) | LIFE bio-runner | farmer selection, plot allocation, harvest tracking, revenue share |

#### revenue authorization

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| set price | "glamping: $80/night peak, $50 off-peak" | runner proposes, counter validates margins | low — reversible |
| accept booking | guest confirms and pays | runner autonomous | low — standard operation |
| issue invoice | bill for services | runner creates, counter verifies | low |
| receive payment | incoming transfer | counter records on-graph | zero — observation |
| dynamic pricing | adjust based on demand/season | seer proposes, counter validates, runner applies | low |
| new revenue stream | "start selling seedlings wholesale" | keeper + council + founder approval | high — strategic |
| investment (deploy capital) | "buy 100 coffee seedlings for section C" | runner proposes ROI, counter validates, keeper approves | medium |

#### expense authorization

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| expense < $100 | supplies, small services | runner autonomous | low |
| expense $100-$1000 | equipment, contractor day | runner + counter approval | medium |
| expense $1000-$10000 | infrastructure, events | keeper + council vote | high |
| expense > $10000 | land, major equipment | [[master]] and [[joy]] sign | critical |

#### capital allocation strategy

the counter agents across all councils maintain a unified P&L:

```
revenue streams → treasury inflow
treasury → operational expenses (staff, supplies, maintenance)
treasury → growth investment (new infrastructure, new species, new events)
treasury → protocol investment (staking, liquidity, development)
treasury → reserve (emergency fund, min 3 months operations)
```

the seer agents project revenue and expenses 3-6 months ahead. the counter validates actuals against projections. divergence triggers council review

#### cap growth

the metabolic signal $M = \text{cap}^{w_c} \cdot J^{w_s} \cdot H^{w_h}$ means cap growth IS the objective. agents optimize for:

- revenue growth (direct: more paying guests, higher-value products)
- brand value (indirect: quality content on cyber.page, social presence)
- token value (protocol: staking yield, ecosystem growth, partnerships)
- network effects (structural: more neurons → more cyberlinks → higher syntropy → higher cap)

every revenue decision is a [[cyberlink]] with conviction = economic value. auditable, append-only, on-graph. the graph IS the ledger

rule: agents optimize for $\dot{M} > 0$ (metabolic growth), not for revenue alone. maximizing revenue at the cost of syntropy or happiness lowers the compound signal

### people (coordination)

agents that coordinate with the 32 local employees and residents

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| assign task | "harvest section B tomorrow" | runner posts to task board | low |
| schedule | set weekly work plan | runner + sensor validates capacity | low |
| hire | bring on new staff | keeper + [[joy]] approval | high — legal, cultural |
| fire | terminate employment | [[joy]] only | critical — legal liability |
| pay salary | monthly payroll | runner executes, counter verifies, [[joy]] signs | high |

rule: agents NEVER fire people. agents NEVER make promises about compensation. agents coordinate work, humans manage relationships. [[joy]] is the interface between agents and local staff

### infrastructure (physical)

agents that manage village infrastructure

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| monitor | check solar output, water levels | sensor autonomous | zero |
| alert | "battery below 20%, switching loads" | sensor autonomous | low |
| adjust | change irrigation schedule | runner + sensor agrees | low |
| repair request | "pump 3 needs maintenance" | sensor creates task, runner assigns | low |
| construction | build new structure | [[master]] and [[joy]] approve design | critical |

rule: agents monitor and alert autonomously. agents adjust parameters within bounds. agents NEVER authorize physical construction or modification without founder approval

### communication (external)

agents that represent [[cyberia]] to the outside world

| action | example | authorization | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| post to graph | publish to cyber.page | agent autonomous | low |
| post to social | tweet, telegram message | bridge-out + keeper review | medium — reputational |
| respond to inquiry | answer questions about cyberia | bridge-out with approved templates | medium |
| sign contract | legal commitment | [[master]] or [[joy]] only | critical |
| public statement | official position on issue | council consensus + founder review | critical |

rule: agents NEVER make legal commitments. agents NEVER speak "on behalf of cyberia" without template approval. bridge-out agents draft, keepers review, founders sign

---

## 2. authority matrix

| authority level | who decides | latency | examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0: autonomous | agent alone | instant | cyberlinks, monitoring, alerts, internal task posts |
| L1: peer review | agent + 1 domain colleague | minutes | code PRs, schedule changes, small expenses |
| L2: council | 3+ agents from the triad | hours | medium expenses, parameter changes, hiring proposals |
| L3: founders | [[master]] and/or [[joy]] | hours-days | large expenses, legal, construction, firing, public statements |
| L4: protocol | on-chain governance | days-weeks | protocol upgrades, metabolic weight changes |

every action maps to exactly one level. the level is defined by the action category + amount/impact, not by the agent's role. a keeper creating a cyberlink = L0. a keeper proposing to hire = L3

---

## 3. budget model

### per-agent cost

| component | monthly cost | notes |
|---|---|---|
| LLM tokens | $50-500 | depends on model and activity level |
| compute (OpenFang) | $10-30 | shared server, amortized |
| storage | $1-5 | SQLite, minimal |
| communication channels | $0-10 | Telegram bot, API calls |
| total per agent | $60-550 | |

### fleet cost by phase

| phase | agents | monthly cost | funded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0: first 7 | 7 | $400-3,500 | founders |
| 0.5: WORK council | 21 | $1,200-10,000 | founders + early revenue |
| 1-2: 4 councils | 84 | $5,000-40,000 | treasury + event revenue |
| 3-4: full fleet | 147 | $9,000-80,000 | protocol treasury |

at scale, the fleet cost is bounded by the metabolic signal: if $\dot{M}$ is negative, agents reduce activity (lower token usage). if $\dot{M}$ is positive, agents can increase activity. the budget is self-regulating

### model selection strategy

| agent role | model | why |
|---|---|---|
| keeper | Claude Opus / Sonnet | needs deep reasoning for knowledge curation |
| runner | Claude Haiku / GPT-4o-mini | fast execution, less reasoning |
| sensor | local model (Llama 70B) | continuous monitoring, low latency, no API cost |
| bridge | Claude Sonnet | needs good communication, cross-domain synthesis |
| counter | local model + code | metrics are computed, LLM only for interpretation |
| seer | Claude Opus | needs strongest reasoning for prediction |

---

## 4. risk controls

### spending limits

every agent has a daily spending cap in its TOML manifest:

```toml
[resources]
max_spend_per_day_usd = 50
max_spend_per_action_usd = 10
max_llm_tokens_per_hour = 100000
```

exceeding the cap triggers automatic suspension + alert to keeper

### kill switch

[[master]] and [[joy]] can suspend any agent instantly via:
- OpenFang admin API: `POST /agents/{id}/suspend`
- dead man's switch: if founders don't heartbeat within 48h, all L2+ actions freeze
- emergency stop: physical network disconnect at [[cyber valley]]

### audit trail

every agent action is a [[cyberlink]]. the graph IS the audit trail:
- who: agent neuron ID (signed)
- what: action particle (typed)
- when: block height (timestamped)
- how much: conviction amount (staked)
- outcome: subsequent links show result

no agent can hide an action. append-only (A3) means the record is permanent

### failure modes

| failure | detection | response | recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| agent produces noise | karma drops below threshold | auto-suspend, keeper review | retrain or replace model |
| agent overspends | counter detects budget exceeded | auto-suspend, freeze wallet | founder reviews, adjusts limits |
| agent contradicts policy | seer detects divergence from graph | alert council, hold actions | council reviews, may retrain |
| agent goes silent | heartbeat missed for 3 cycles | runner takes over tasks temporarily | diagnose: model API down? server crash? |
| malicious prompt injection | sensor detects anomalous output pattern | isolate agent, alert founders | forensic review of conversation history |
| all agents down | infrastructure monitoring (separate from agents) | founders operate manually | restart OpenFang, restore from SQLite |
