management objects and process system for 147 [[neurons]] — what they control and how work flows through [[cyber valley]]

---

## management objects

every object the agent network manages is a [[particle]] in the [[cybergraph]]. agents create [[cyberlinks]] to objects, recording state, decisions, and measurements. the graph IS the management system

### 1. territory

37 hectares divided into operational zones

| zone | area | function | managing agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| gardens | ~5 ha | food production, [[permaculture]], [[species]] cultivation | SPACE eco-runner, LIFE bio-runner |
| forest | ~15 ha | timber ([[bamboo]], [[trema]], [[albizia chinensis]]), carbon stock, biodiversity | SPACE eco-keeper, eco-sensor |
| infrastructure | ~3 ha | buildings, roads, parking, solar arrays, water systems | WORK tech-runner |
| pasture | ~4 ha | sheep, chickens, composting, fodder | LIFE bio-runner |
| events | ~2 ha | [[soft3]], outdoor spaces, [[Burn.City]] grounds | PLAY socio-runner |
| nursery | ~1 ha | seedlings, propagation, experiments | LIFE bio-keeper |
| buffer/reserve | ~7 ha | untouched forest, watershed protection, wildlife corridor | SPACE eco-sensor (monitor only) |

each zone is a particle. zone state (planted species, soil tests, water flow, canopy cover) is recorded as [[cyberlinks]] from the zone particle to measurement particles. history is append-only

### 2. buildings

## process system

every process is a cycle: sense → decide → act → measure. sensors trigger it, runners execute it, counters verify it, keepers record it

### daily processes

| process | time | trigger | agents involved | output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| morning briefing | 06:00 | cron | all sensors → bridge-out | daily status to Telegram: weather, solar yield, water levels, task queue |
| staff task assignment | 07:00 | briefing complete | runners | task board updated with day's work per zone |
| harvest check | 08:00 | seasonal calendar + sensor data | eco-sensor, bio-runner | harvest list: what to pick today, which zone |
| infrastructure check | 09:00 | sensor readings | tech-sensor | alert if any system anomalous, otherwise silent |
| guest coordination | 10:00 | booking calendar | socio-runner | arrivals, departures, special requests for today |
| graph maintenance | continuous | new content, broken links, stale pages | cyber-keeper | edits, new pages, link repairs |
| evening report | 18:00 | cron | counters → bridge-out | daily P&L, task completion rate, anomalies |
| night monitoring | 22:00-06:00 | continuous | sensors (low power mode) | alerts only: security, weather, infrastructure |

### weekly processes

| process | day | trigger | agents involved | output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| zone planning | Monday | weekly cycle | keepers + runners per zone | week's work plan: which zones, which tasks, which staff |
| market/sales | Tuesday | inventory levels + demand | eco-runner, socio-runner | what to sell, where, at what price |
| maintenance cycle | Wednesday | sensor reports + staff feedback | tech-runner | preventive maintenance schedule |
| knowledge review | Thursday | graph metrics | cyber-keeper, domain keepers | pages to create, update, or link |
| council sync | Friday | weekly cycle | bridge-in agents from each active council | cross-domain priorities, resource conflicts |
| financial review | Saturday | counter reports | counters → bridge-out | weekly P&L, budget vs actual, cash position |
| metabolic review | Sunday | weekly M(t) computation | seer agents | $\dot{M}$ trajectory, which component needs attention |

### monthly processes

| process | trigger | agents involved | output | founder involvement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| payroll preparation | month end | counters | staff hours, deductions, net pay | [[joy]] approves and signs |
| P&L closing | month end | all counters | consolidated monthly financials | founder review |
| species inventory | monthly | bio-counter | updated species database, growth measurements | none |
| infrastructure audit | monthly | tech-sensor + tech-counter | equipment status, replacement schedule | founder review if >$1000 |
| content publication | monthly | cyber-keeper + bridge-out | monthly highlights for cyber.page, social | bridge drafts, keeper reviews |
| tri-kernel recompute | monthly | WORK cyber-runner | fresh focus scores in all frontmatter, context packs rebuilt | none (automated) |

### seasonal processes

| process | season | trigger | agents involved | output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| coffee harvest | May-Aug | cherry ripeness (eco-sensor) | eco-runner coordinates staff, bio-runner quality control | dried parchment → processing → roasting → sales |
| planting cycle | Oct-Nov (wet season start) | soil moisture + calendar | eco-keeper selects species, bio-runner coordinates planting | new plantings recorded, nursery restocked |
| [[Burn.City]] | annual (Feb-Mar) | calendar + planning 6mo ahead | all PLAY council + SPACE eco (food) + WORK tech (infra) | event execution: 150 people, 30 days |
| dry season prep | Apr | weather forecast + water levels | geo-sensor, tech-runner | water rationing plan, fire prevention, mulching |
| wet season prep | Sep | weather forecast | tech-runner, eco-runner | drainage check, erosion control, greenhouse prep |
| annual assessment | Dec | year end | all seers → bridge-out | year in review: metabolic trajectory, achievements, failures, plan for next year |

### event-driven processes (ad-hoc)

| trigger | process | responding agents | escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| booking request | qualify → price → confirm → prepare | socio-runner | auto for standard, L1 for custom |
| equipment failure | detect → diagnose → repair/replace | tech-sensor → tech-runner | L2 if >$500 replacement |
| weather emergency | alert → protect → assess damage | geo-sensor → all runners | L3 if structural damage |
| new species discovered | document → identify → catalog → plan | bio-sensor → bio-keeper | none (knowledge action) |
| visitor/media inquiry | receive → qualify → draft response → review | bridge-in → bridge-out → keeper | L3 for media, L1 for casual |
| staff issue | surface concern → escalate to [[joy]] | any agent detects → bridge-in | always L3 (human domain) |
| security incident | detect → alert → respond | tech-sensor → [[master]] direct | always L3 |
| cash flow crunch | counter detects shortfall → alert | all counters → seers → founders | L3 — founder decision |

## process dependencies

```
              morning briefing
              /       |       \
    staff tasks    harvest    infra check
         |            |           |
    zone work    processing   maintenance
         |            |           |
    evening report ←──┴───────────╯
         |
    daily P&L
         |
    weekly review (Friday) ←── all daily P&Ls
         |
    metabolic review (Sunday)
         |
    next week planning (Monday)
```

the cycle is fractal: daily loops feed weekly reviews, weekly reviews feed monthly P&L, monthly P&L feeds seasonal planning, seasonal planning feeds annual assessment. each layer operates at its own timescale. the [[heat]] kernel smooths across scales — daily noise washes out, seasonal signal survives
